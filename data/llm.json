Example: A spam email classifier trained on emails labeled as spam or not spam. Unsupervised learning uses data without labels. The model tries to identify patterns or structures in the data. Example: Customer segmentation using clustering algorithms like K-Means, where the model groups customers based on purchasing behavior without predefined categories."
